<h2 style="color: red;">PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>I was born in Zhejiang, China, and got my B.S in Mathematics at <a href="https://english.hznu.edu.cn">Hangzhou Normal University</a>, under the supervision of Professor Zhiyuan Xu.


<h2 style="color: red;">RESEARCH INTERESTS</h2>
<p>My research interests lie in partial differential equations and geometric analysis, inculding nonlinear elliptic PDEs, geometric measure theory. Recently, I was interested in the convergence of Allen-Cahn equation and some aspects about mean curvature flow.
